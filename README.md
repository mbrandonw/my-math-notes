# My Math

I was in [graduate school](http://math.sunysb.edu/~mbw) for a number of years, and this is a collection of the notes/papers I wrote.

## [Classifying Spaces and Representability Theorems](./classifying-spaces-and-representability-theorems)

The foundations and statement of the Brown Representability Theorem, a very general result on representing functors as morphisms into a single object. There is a far more general result known as the [Yoneda Lemma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoneda_lemma) that is very applicable to computer science.

## [Computations in Khovanov Homology](./computations-in-khovanov-homology)

Just some examples of how to compute an object known as [Khovanov Homology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khovanov_homology).

## [Gauge Theory](./guage-theory)

I spent one summer trying to learn some physics and this is the resulting notes.

## [Homotopy Theory](./homotopy-theory)

Homotopy Theory is the most important field in  all of mathematics, physics and computer science. So, these are some of my notes on it.

## [Lee's Variant of Khovanov Homology](./lees-variant-of-khovanov-homology)

Notes on Lee's variant of Khovanov homology, which leads to a spectral sequence.

## [Low Dimensional Topology](./low-dimensional-topology)

Notes I made while preparing for my [oral exam](./oral-exam).

## [Oral Exam Syllabus](./oral-syllabus)

Syllabus for my oral exam in graduate school.

## [Spectral Sequences](./spectral-sequences)

An incredibly complicated object arising often in algebra and topology.
